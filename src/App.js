    <h1>Higher-Order Components</h1>
    <strong>Higher-order components in React were inspired by higher-order functions in JavaScript. A HOC is an advanced technique for reusing logic in React components. It is a pattern created out of Reactâ€™s compositional nature.</strong>

    <p>The purpose of a HOC is to enhance a component (usually a dumb component) with extra functionality. A HOC allows for reusability since in real-life applications there is a need to re-use the same functionalities in various similar kinds of components. A very common functionality is toggling.</p>
